									<p>The llama is a South American relative of the camel, though the llama does not have a hump. 
									These sturdy creatures are domestic animals used by the peoples of the Andes Mountains. (Their wild 
									relatives are guanacos and vicuñas). Native peoples have used llamas as pack animals for centuries.</p>

												<h4>Llama dung makes great fuel</h4>
												<p>Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America 
												about 40 million years ago. They migrated to South America about 3 million years ago. 
												At the end of the last ice age between 10,000 and 12,000 llama’s became completely 
												extinct in North America.</p>

												<h4>Llamas can reach speeds up to 35mph</h4>
												<p>Today llamas live throughout the Americas, Europe and Australia as domesticated livestock.
												They prefer mountainous terrain whether mountainous deserts or grasslands. Llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years, 
												with some individuals surviving 30 years or more. The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 meters 
												(5.6 to 5.9 feet) tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kilograms (290 and 440 pounds).</p>

												<h4>Llamas are pack animals, and can carry 50 to 75 pounds up to 20 miles</h4>
												<p>Llamas communicate with each other through a variety of ear, tail and body postures. They also have a range 
												of vocalisations including soft hums and a shrill alarm call to warn others of danger. When one llama has an 
												issue with another llama, it will stick its tongue out to express its displeasure. They’ll also spit on other llamas. 
												Llamas are herbivores. Llamas eat grass, hay, and grain, and as browsers, also like bark and twigs. For treats they 
												love cut up apples and carrots.</p>

									<h3>About Volan Nnanpalle:</h3>
									<h1>Who am I?</h1>
									<p>I am Volan Nnanpalle. I am currently a senior at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science and 
									expect to graduate in the Fall of 2018. I've had the
									opportunity to gain experience in the Education & Utility industries through internships. I believe that if you have the means to help someone you should. As an athletic individual I
									have played tennis at The Pennsylvania State University (Berks Campus) and have won the North Eastern Atlantic Conference in Doubles (2014-2015). At Bloomsburg University I am
									a member of the Orientation Workshop Leaders (OWLS) and also a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) where I serve as the Resources Coordinator. On my 
									free time I love watching funny videos and movies with friends. </p>
									<h1>Why am I excited about being a front-end developer in today's web landscape?</h1>
									<p>It's hard to predict what's going to be the charm of industry in the future but Front-End Web Development is a skill which is here to stay. With technology improving 
									everyday and developers needing to adapt the constant challenge excites me. This enables us developers to grow and learn new information to implement on to our websites. 
									Compared to Back-End Development you can also see the fruits of your labor faster as a Front-End Developer - changes are almost always instantaneous, whereas some types of back-end tasks 
									(running feature tests or data migrations, for example) can take some waiting before you see results.  </p>
									<h1>Why did I build my site the way I did?</h1>
									<p>While developing the website my goal was to leave a lasting impression on the user. When developing the llama website I wanted to make sure users across 
									multiple platforms such as desktop computers, tablets and smart phones were able to view the 
									llama website and enjoy all its functionality. A Front-End developers goal is always to grab the users attention. To accomplish this I used different infographics to 
									acquire this result when a user arrived on the Majestic Llama site. . With these infographics the site viewers are able to get information which I believe to be important 
									in a form of an eye-catching image.</p>
									</br>
									<h3>Contact The Majestic Llama</h3>
									<p>Llamas do not have specific time of mating. Male usually chases female for up to 10 minutes until she is finally ready to mate.</p>
